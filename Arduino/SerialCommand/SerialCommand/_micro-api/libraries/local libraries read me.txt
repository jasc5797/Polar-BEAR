Local libraries should conform to the Arduino Library Specification https://github.com/arduino/arduino/wiki/arduino-ide-1.5:-library-specification

The top level source code folder of each #included Arduino library automatically becomes a compiler include (-I). 

The primary source folder for more recent Arduino libraries is the 'LibName\src' sub folder.

It is highly recommended to ensure the name of a library header (.h) has the same name as the library folder and that header is #included in code. For example \Library1\Library1.h

The "Deep Search for Libraries" facility will find libraries #included in ino/cpp/c files and will correctly find #includes that are inside valid #if conditions, but it has a performance impact on the compiler.

If the project does not use conditional #if statement to #include libraries then a simpler faster system is to switch off "Deep Search for Libraries" and ensure that a Library header is #include in the INO code. In this event Visual Micro will use a high speed regex expression to find library #includes regardless of #if conditions.

Arduino libraries must always be #included in source code without qualifying the path to the library. 

For example this IS correct:-

	#include <Library1.h>

These are NOT correct:-

	#include <Library1/Library1.h>
	#include <../foo/baa/Libraries/Library1/Library1.h>
